 * <p>Stores a pronunciation lexicon in an Amazon Web Services Region. If
 *       a lexicon with the same name already exists in the region, it is
 *       overwritten by the new lexicon. Lexicon operations have eventual
 *       consistency, therefore, it might take some time before the lexicon is
 *       available to the SynthesizeSpeech operation.</p>

 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { PollyClient, PutLexiconCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-polly"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { PollyClient, PutLexiconCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-polly"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new PollyClient(config);
 * const command = new PutLexiconCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```

 * @see {@link PutLexiconCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link PutLexiconCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link PollyClientResolvedConfig | config} for PollyClient's `config` shape.
